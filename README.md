# calculator
A JavaScript control flow calculator that I created on day five of my coding bootcamp.

You need to first state which operator you want to use and then plug your numbers in.

Please note that I need to tweak the mortgage calculator: at present it is not accurate, so don't use it to work out your mortgage repayments!
